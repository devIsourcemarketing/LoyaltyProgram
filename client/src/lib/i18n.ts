          question: 'What do you mean by "plays"?',
          answer: "Plays are the sales you register during the month, whether from new customers or renewals. Each play translates into goals, which you can accumulate to redeem for monthly prizes."
        },
        q2: {
          question: "What are goals?",
          answer: `Goals are the points you earn for each play registered.

          - For every US$1,000 in sales to new customers, you earn 1 goal.

          - For every US$2,000 in renewal sales, you also earn 1 goal.`
        },
        q3: {
          question: "How can I be the top scorer of the season?",
          answer: `The more plays you register, the more goals you will accumulate. You can see your progress on the "Top Scorers of the Season" leaderboard within the platform's main dashboard. The participant with the most accumulated goals by April 2026—by Partner level, market segment, and region—will win the Grand Prize: an all-inclusive ticket to a World Cup match.`
        },
        q4: {
          question: "How do I register a play?",
          answer: `To register a play and start scoring goals, follow these steps:

          1. Log in to the KUDOS platform and register your sale.

          2. The Kaspersky Cup team will review and validate the information.

          3. If the sale is valid, it will be converted into a play, and the goals will be automatically added.

          4. You will receive an email notification and an in-platform notification when a play is registered in your name.

          5. You can view all your accumulated goals on the main dashboard.

          Important: Only sales registered and validated on KUDOS will be considered plays within the Kaspersky Cup. Unvalidated sales will not generate goals.`
        },
        q5: {
          question: "How do I redeem my goals for the prize of the month?",
          answer: `Go to the “My Prizes” section to see the available prize, its image, and the number of goals required to redeem it. If you meet the requirements, click “Redeem.” Your request will be reviewed by the Kaspersky Cup team, and you will be notified when it is approved.`
        },
        q6: {
          question: "When can I redeem my goals?",
          answer: `Sales can be registered throughout the month (for example, from December 1st to 31st). As they are validated, the goals accumulate.

          - The valid date will always be the date of the transaction processed by Kaspersky, regardless of when it was registered in KUDOS.

          - If you reach the required goals before the end of the month, you can redeem your reward immediately.

          - You also have a grace period until the 10th of the following month to redeem the previous month's reward, provided the sale that generated the goals has the corresponding valid date.

          Redemption is subject to reward availability at the time of the request.`
        },
        q7: {
          question: "How long does it take for my reward redemption to be approved?",
          answer: "Your request will be reviewed within a maximum of 5 days. You will receive a confirmation email when your reward has been approved and is ready for shipment. You can also check the status in the 'My Redemptions' section of the platform."
        },
        q8: {
          question: "What should I do if I don't see my goals reflected?",
          answer: `Goals are automatically assigned once your sales are registered and approved.
          If more than 15 days have passed since you registered with KUDOS and you still don't see your goals reflected, please contact the support team.`
        },
        q9: {
          question: "Do the prizes have an expiration date?",
          answer: `Yes. Prizes change every month and require different amounts of goals to redeem.

          - We recommend checking the catalog frequently, as prizes are limited and are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.

          - If a prize is sold out, you will not be able to redeem it, even if you have the required goals.

          - Prize images are for illustrative purposes only; the final product may vary depending on availability in each country.

          Remember that at the end of the season, if you are the top scorer, you can win the Grand Prize: an all-inclusive ticket to a World Cup match.`
        },
        q10: {
          question: "What does the Grand Prize include?",
          answer: `The grand prize includes:

          - One (1) single ticket to a 2026 FIFA World Cup match

          - Round-trip flights

          - Accommodation

          - Meals

          This prize is personal and non-transferable. If the winner is unable to travel, the prize will automatically be awarded to the runner-up.`
        },
        q11: {
          question: "How is the Grand Prize awarded?",
          answer: `You don't need to take any further action. If you are the top scorer in your category (Partner level, market segment, and region), we will send you an email notification, and the Kaspersky Cup team will contact you to coordinate the official delivery.`
        },
        q12: {
          question: "How can I track my prize shipment?",
          answer: `Once your prize has been approved and shipped, the Kaspersky Cup team will confirm the delivery details, and you will receive an email with the shipping confirmation.
          You can also check the status in the "My Redemptions" section of the platform. There you will see if your request is Pending, Approved, Shipped, or Delivered.`

      TyCtitle7: "7. Grand Prize",
      TyCtext7: `The participant with the highest number of accumulated goals by April 2026 in each of the following categories will be declared the Grand Prize winner:

      - Partner Level

      - Market Segment

      - Region

      The Grand Prize includes:

      - One (1) individual ticket to a 2026 FIFA World Cup match

      - Round-trip flights

      - Accommodation

      - Meals

      This prize is personal and non-transferable. If the winner is unable to travel for any reason, the prize will automatically be awarded to the participant who finishes second in the corresponding ranking.`,
      TyCtitle8: "8. Travel Prize Conditions",
      TyCtext8: `- You are responsible for having a valid passport, visa (if applicable), and complying with all applicable health and immigration requirements.

      - Any additional expenses not specified as included (airport transfers, tips, personal expenses, local taxes, etc.) are your responsibility.

      - The match ticket cannot be exchanged for another event or transferred to third parties.

      - Goals cannot be donated, transferred, or accumulated between participants.

      If the winner does not meet the travel requirements, they forfeit the prize without compensation. No transfer, refund, or substitution will be permitted.`,
      TyCtitle9: "9. Validity and Expiration of Prizes",
      TyCtext9: `- Monthly prizes must be redeemed exclusively within the month in which they were offered.

      - Once this period has ended, participants will have an additional grace period until the 10th of the following month to redeem their prize, provided the sale that generated the goals has a valid date within the prize month.

      - If participants do not redeem their prize within the indicated period, they will forfeit the right to redeem that prize, without the right to compensation or replacement.

      - Prizes are subject to availability at the time of the request. If the prize inventory for the month is depleted, no further redemptions can be processed, even if the participant has the required goals.

      - Goals not used in a given month cannot be used to redeem prizes for subsequent months, although they will continue to be added to the calculation of the season's Grand Prize.

      - Goals cannot be exchanged for cash or additional rewards after the Program closes.

      - In the event that the monthly prize is not available in the participant's country, and only in exceptional circumstances, Kaspersky may award a prize of equivalent value in the form of an electronic gift card (e.g., Amazon Gift Card), subject to local availability and the provider's terms and conditions.

      - The images or photographs of the prizes displayed on the platform or in Program communications are for illustrative purposes only. The prizes awarded may vary in features, design, color, or availability, depending on the country and the local provider. In such cases, a prize of equivalent value or category will be awarded, without this constituting a breach of contract on the part of Kaspersky.`,
      TyCtitle10: "10. Program Modifications",
      TyCtext10: `Kaspersky reserves the right to modify, suspend, or cancel the Program, its terms, prizes, or conditions at any time and without prior notice. Modifications will be communicated through the official Kaspersky Cup channels.`,
      TyCtitle11: "11. Limitation of Liability",
      TyCtext11: `Kaspersky will not be liable for:

      - Delays in prize delivery

      - Event cancellations

      - Logistical or administrative problems of third parties (airlines, hotels, suppliers)

      - Damages, losses, or harm arising directly or indirectly from participation in the Program

      Kaspersky's liability is limited exclusively to the value of the prize won.`,
      TyCtitle12: "12. Processing of Personal Data",
      TyCtext12: `By participating, you authorize Kaspersky to collect and process your personal data (name, email, contact information, sales data, among others) for purposes related to the management of the Program and the delivery of prizes. You also authorize the receipt of communications and notifications related to your participation.`,

          question: '¿A qué se refieren con "jugadas"?',
          answer: "Las jugadas son las ventas que usted registra durante el mes, ya sean de nuevos clientes o renovaciones. Cada jugada se traduce en goles, que puede acumular para canjear premios mensuales."
        },
        q2: {
          question: "¿Qué son los goles?",
          answer: `Los goles son los puntos que obtiene por cada jugada registrada. 

           - Por cada US$1,000 en ventas a nuevos clientes, usted gana 1 gol.

           - Por cada US$2,000 en ventas de renovaciones, también gana 1 gol.`
        },
        q3: {
          question: "¿Cómo puedo ser el goleador de la temporada?",
          answer: 'Cuantas más jugadas registre, más goles acumulará. Puede ver su progreso en el marcador "Los goleadores de la temporada" dentro del panel principal de la plataforma. El participante con más goles acumulados hasta abril de 2026 —por nivel de Partner, segmento de mercado y región— será el ganador del Gran Premio: una entrada para un partido del Mundial con todo incluido.'
        },
        q4: {
          question: "¿Cómo registro una jugada?",
          answer: `Para registrar una jugada y comenzar a sumar goles, siga estos pasos: 

          1. Ingrese a la plataforma KUDOS y registre su venta. 

          2. El equipo de Kaspersky Cup revisará y validará la información. 

          3. Si la venta es válida, será convertida en una jugada y los goles serán sumados automáticamente. 

          4. Recibirá una notificación por correo y dentro de la plataforma cuando se registre una jugada a su nombre. 

          5. Podrá ver todos sus goles acumulados en el panel principal. 

          Importante: solo las ventas registradas y validadas en KUDOS serán consideradas como jugadas dentro de Kaspersky Cup. Las ventas no validadas no generarán goles.`
        },
        q5: {
          question: "¿Cómo canjeo mis goles por el premio del mes?",
          answer: `Ingrese a la sección “Mis premios” para ver el premio disponible, su imagen y la cantidad de goles necesarios para canjearlo. Si cumple con los requisitos, haga clic en “Canjear”. Su solicitud será revisada por el equipo de Kaspersky Cup y se le notificará cuando sea aprobada.`

          answer: `Las ventas se pueden registrar durante todo el mes (por ejemplo, del 1 al 31 de diciembre). A medida que se validan, los goles se van acumulando.
          
          - La fecha válida siempre será la de la transacción procesada por Kaspersky, sin importar cuándo se haya registrado en KUDOS.

          - Si alcanza los goles necesarios antes de finalizar el mes, puede canjear su premio de inmediato.

          - Además, dispone de un período de gracia hasta el día 10 del mes siguiente para redimir el premio del mes anterior, siempre que la venta que generó los goles tenga la fecha válida correspondiente.

          El canje está sujeto a la disponibilidad del premio en el momento de la solicitud.`
        },
        q7: {
          question: "¿Cuánto tiempo tarda en aprobarse la redención de mi premio?",
          answer: "Su solicitud será revisada en un plazo máximo de 5 días. Recibirá un correo de confirmación cuando su premio haya sido aprobado y esté listo para el envío. También puede verificar el estado en la sección “Mis redenciones” de la plataforma."
        },
        q8: {
          question: "¿Qué hago si no veo mis goles reflejados?",
          answer: `Los goles se asignan automáticamente una vez que sus ventas son registradas y aprobadas.
          Si han pasado más de 15 días desde el registro en KUDOS y no ve reflejados sus goles, por favor, comuníquese con el equipo de soporte.`
        },
        q9: {
          question: "¿Los premios tienen fecha de vencimiento?",
          answer: `Sí. Los premios cambian cada mes y requieren diferentes cantidades de goles para ser canjeados.

          - Le recomendamos revisar el catálogo con frecuencia, ya que los premios son limitados y se asignan por orden de canje.

          - Si un premio se agota, no podrá redimirlo, incluso si cuenta con los goles necesarios.

          - Las imágenes de los premios son referenciales; el producto final puede variar según disponibilidad en cada país.

          Recuerde que al final de la temporada, si usted es el máximo goleador, podrá ganar el Gran Premio: una entrada para un partido del Mundial con todo incluido.`
        },
        q10: {
          question: "¿Qué incluye el Gran Premio?",
          answer: `El premio mayor incluye:

          - Una (1) entrada individual para un partido del Mundial de Fútbol FIFA 2026

          - Vuelos ida y vuelta

          - Hospedaje

          - Alimentación

          Este premio es personal e intransferible. Si el ganador no puede realizar el viaje, el premio será otorgado automáticamente al participante que ocupe el segundo lugar.`
        },
        q11: {
          question: "¿Cómo se entrega el Gran Premio?",
          answer: `No necesita realizar ninguna acción adicional. Si resulta ser el máximo goleador por categoría (nivel de Partner, segmento de mercado y región), le enviaremos una notificación por correo y el equipo de Kaspersky Cup se pondrá en contacto con usted para coordinar la entrega oficial.`
        },
        q12: {
          question: "¿Cómo puedo rastrear el envío de mi premio?",
          answer: `Una vez aprobado y enviado su premio, el equipo de Kaspersky Cup le confirmará los datos de entrega y recibirá un correo con la confirmación del envío.
          También puede revisar el estado en la sección “Mis redenciones” de la plataforma. Allí verá si su solicitud está Pendiente, Aprobada, Enviada o Entregada.`

          question: 'O que são as jogadas?',
          answer: "As jogadas são os negócios ou vendas que você realiza durante o mês, seja com novos clientes ou renovações. Cada jogada se transforma em gols que você pode acumular para resgatar prêmios todos os meses."
        },
        q2: {
          question: "O que são os gols?",
          answer: `Os gols são os pontos que você ganha por cada jogada registrada.

          - A cada US$ 1.000 em pedidos de novos clientes, você recebe 1 gol.

          - A cada US$ 2.000 em pedidos de renovações, você recebe 1 gol.`
        },
        q3: {
          question: "Como posso me tornar o artilheiro da temporada?",
          answer: `Quanto mais jogadas você realizar a cada mês, mais gols irá acumular. Seu total de gols aparece no marcador “Os artilheiros da temporada” dentro do painel principal.
          O participante que tiver o maior número de gols acumulados até abril de 2026, considerando cada nível de Parceiro, Segmento de Mercado e Região, ganhará o Grande Prêmio: um ingresso para assistir a um jogo da Copa do Mundo com tudo incluído.`
        },
        q4: {
          question: "Como uma nova jogada é registrada?",
          answer: `Para registrar uma jogada e começar a acumular gols, siga estes passos:

          1. Registre suas vendas na plataforma KUDOS. Somente as vendas registradas ali poderão ser consideradas para o programa.

          2. A equipe do Kaspersky Cup revisará e validará as suas vendas no KUDOS. Se uma venda não for válida, ela não poderá se converter em gol.

          3. As vendas validadas se transformarão em jogadas dentro do programa e serão adicionadas diretamente pela equipe do Kaspersky Cup. Com cada jogada, você acumulará gols.

          4. Quando uma jogada for registrada em seu nome, você receberá uma notificação por e-mail e dentro da plataforma para verificar os gols somados.

          5. Você poderá ver seus gols acumulados no painel principal da plataforma.

          Importante: Somente as vendas registradas e validadas no KUDOS serão consideradas jogadas dentro do Kaspersky Cup. Vendas não validadas não gerarão gols.`
        },
        q5: {
          question: "Como posso resgatar meus gols pelo prêmio do mês?",
          answer: `Acesse a seção “Meus prêmios”, onde você verá a imagem do prêmio disponível e a quantidade de gols necessária para resgatá-lo. Se você tiver gols suficientes, basta clicar em “Resgatar”. Sua solicitação será analisada pela equipe do Kaspersky Cup e você receberá uma notificação quando o resgate for aprovado.`
        },
        q6: {
          question: "Quando posso resgatar meus gols?",
          answer: `As vendas são registradas ao longo de todo o mês (por exemplo, de 1º a 31 de dezembro), e os gols são acumulados conforme essas vendas são validadas pela equipe do Kaspersky Cup dentro do KUDOS.

          - A data válida da venda será sempre a data real da transação processada pela Kaspersky, independentemente de quando ela tenha sido registrada no KUDOS ou validada na plataforma.

          - Durante cada mês, você poderá ver quantos gols acumulou e, se alcançar a quantidade necessária para resgatar o Prêmio do Mês, poderá fazer o resgate. Se você atingir os gols necessários antes do fim do mês, poderá resgatar o prêmio a qualquer momento dentro desse mesmo período.

          - Além disso, você terá um período de tolerância até o dia 10 do mês seguinte para realizar o resgate do prêmio referente ao mês anterior, desde que a venda que gerou os gols tenha a data válida correspondente ao mês do prêmio.

          O resgate está sujeito à disponibilidade do prêmio no momento da solicitação.`
        },
        q7: {
          question: "Em quanto tempo meu resgate é aprovado?",
          answer: "Sua solicitação será analisada em um prazo de (5 dias). Você receberá um e-mail quando o seu prêmio for aprovado e estiver pronto para envio. Você também pode verificar o status diretamente na plataforma, na seção “Minhas redações”."
        },
        q8: {
          question: "O que faço se eu não visualizar meus gols?",
          answer: `Os gols são atribuídos automaticamente quando suas vendas são registradas e aprovadas dentro do programa. Se já se passaram mais de 15 dias desde o registro da venda no KUDOS e os gols ainda não apareceram, entre em contato com a equipe de suporte.`
        },
        q9: {
          question: "Os prêmios têm data de expiração?",
          answer: `Sim. Os prêmios mudam a cada mês e exigem uma quantidade diferente de gols para serem resgatados. Cada prêmio é melhor que o anterior, por isso recomendamos que você confira o catálogo regularmente para não perder nenhuma oportunidade.
          
          - Lembre-se de que os prêmios mensais têm quantidade limitada e são concedidos de acordo com a ordem em que o resgate é solicitado. Se o prêmio se esgotar, não será possível resgatá-lo, mesmo que você tenha os gols necessários.
          
          - Além disso, as imagens exibidas dos prêmios são ilustrativas; o prêmio real pode variar ligeiramente conforme a disponibilidade em cada país.
          
          E, no final da temporada, se você for o maior goleador, terá a chance de ganhar o Grande Prêmio: um ingresso para assistir a um jogo da Copa do Mundo com tudo incluído.`
        },
        q10: {
          question: "O que inclui o Grande Prêmio?",
          answer: `O Grande Prêmio inclui:

          - Um (1) ingresso individual para um jogo da Copa do Mundo FIFA 2026
          
          - Passagens aéreas de ida e volta
          
          - Hospedagem
          
          - Alimentação

          Este prêmio é pessoal e intransferível, portanto só pode ser utilizado pelo próprio vencedor.
          Se, por qualquer motivo, o vencedor não puder realizar a viagem, o prêmio será automaticamente transferido para o participante que estiver em segundo lugar.
`
        },
        q11: {
          question: "Como o Grande Prêmio é entregue?",
          answer: `Você não precisa realizar nenhuma ação adicional. Se for o maior goleador por nível de Parceiro, Segmento de Mercado e Região, você será notificado por e-mail, e a equipe do Kaspersky Cup entrará em contato com você para coordenar a entrega oficial do prêmio.`
        },
        q12: {
          question: "Como posso rastrear o envio do meu prêmio?",
          answer: `Quando o seu prêmio for aprovado e enviado, a equipe do Kaspersky Cup entrará em contato para confirmar os dados de entrega. Depois disso, você receberá um e-mail com a confirmação do envio.
          Você também pode acompanhar o status do seu prêmio na seção “Minhas redensões”, onde poderá ver se ele está como Pendente, Aprovado, Enviado ou Entregue.`

      1. Registro das vendas no KUDOS: Todas as vendas devem ser registradas previamente pelo participante na plataforma KUDOS. Somente essas vendas serão consideradas para participação no Kaspersky Cup.
      
      2. Revisão pela equipe do Kaspersky Cup: A equipe do Kaspersky Cup revisará as vendas registradas no KUDOS, verificará sua validade e adicionará ao Programa apenas as vendas consideradas válidas.
      
      3. Conversão em jogada: As vendas validadas no KUDOS serão convertidas em jogadas e adicionadas ao Programa pela equipe do Kaspersky Cup. Cada jogada permitirá ao participante acumular gols.
      
      4. Notificação de jogada registrada: Quando uma jogada for registrada em nome do participante, ele receberá uma notificação por e-mail e dentro da plataforma com o detalhamento dos gols acumulados.
      
      5. Visualização dos gols: Os gols acumulados estarão disponíveis no painel principal da plataforma.
      
      Importante: As vendas que não estiverem registradas e validadas no KUDOS não serão consideradas jogadas e, portanto, não gerarão gols.
      
      - Durante cada mês, os participantes poderão visualizar seu total de gols acumulados no painel da plataforma e poderão resgatar o Prêmio do Mês caso tenham alcançado a quantidade necessária.
      
      - Se o participante atingir os gols necessários antes do final do mês, poderá realizar o resgate imediatamente e em qualquer momento dentro desse mesmo período.
      
      Além disso, o participante contará com um período de tolerância até o dia 10 do mês seguinte para concluir o resgate do prêmio referente ao mês anterior, desde que a venda tenha uma data válida dentro do mês correspondente ao prêmio.
      
      O resgate estará sempre sujeito à disponibilidade do prêmio no momento da solicitação`,
      TyCtitle6: "6. Resgate dos prêmios do mês",
      TyCtext6: `O participante poderá resgatar seus gols acumulados a cada mês pelo “Prêmio do Mês” disponível, selecionando a opção “Resgatar” na seção “Meus prêmios”. A equipe do Kaspersky Cup revisará a solicitação e notificará sua aprovação. Os prêmios mudam a cada mês e cada um é melhor do que o anterior.
      
      A data válida da venda será sempre a data real da transação processada pela Kaspersky, independentemente da data de registro no KUDOS ou de sua validação.
      
      Os prêmios mensais possuem quantidade limitada e serão concedidos conforme a ordem em que as solicitações de resgate forem recebidas. Uma vez esgotado o estoque do mês, não será possível processar novos resgates, mesmo que o participante tenha a quantidade necessária de gols.
      
      É importante mencionar que as imagens ou fotografias dos prêmios mensais exibidas na plataforma ou nas comunicações do Programa são meramente ilustrativas. Os prêmios entregues podem apresentar variações em características, design ou disponibilidade, dependendo do país ou fornecedor.`,
      TyCtitle7: "7. Grande Prêmio",
      TyCtext7: `O participante que acumular o maior número de gols por nível de Parceiro, Segmento de Mercado e Região até o final de abril de 2026 será declarado o vencedor do Grande Prêmio. O Grande Prêmio consiste em:
      
      - Um (1) ingresso individual para um jogo da Copa do Mundo FIFA 2026

      - Passagens aéreas de ida e volta, hospedagem e alimentação incluídas
      
      Este prêmio é pessoal e intransferível. O vencedor não poderá delegá-lo, cedê-lo ou transferi-lo a outra pessoa sob nenhuma circunstância.
      
      Caso o vencedor não possa viajar por qualquer motivo, o prêmio será automaticamente atribuído ao participante que ocupar o segundo lugar na tabela de posições correspondente.`,
      TyCtitle8: "8. Termos específicos do Prêmio de Viagem",
      TyCtext8: `- O vencedor é responsável por possuir passaporte válido, vistos (quando aplicável), seguro de viagem e por cumprir todos os requisitos necessários para viajar (documentação, requisitos de saúde, entre outros).
      
      - Custos adicionais não especificados como incluídos — como transporte até o aeroporto, gorjetas, gastos pessoais, impostos locais, entre outros — serão de responsabilidade exclusiva do vencedor.
      
      - O ingresso para o jogo não poderá ser alterado para outro evento ou data. O vencedor deverá comparecer ao jogo designado.
      
      - Os prêmios, incluindo o ingresso para a Copa do Mundo, não poderão ser convertidos em dinheiro, nem transferidos ou cedidos a outra pessoa.
      
      - O vencedor não poderá doar nem transferir seus gols para outro participante em nenhuma circunstância.
      
      - Este prêmio é estritamente pessoal, e não poderá ser transferido, delegado, presenteado ou cedido a qualquer outra pessoa sob hipótese alguma.
      
      - Caso o vencedor não possa realizar a viagem por falta de documentação, requisitos, restrições pessoais ou qualquer outro motivo, ele perderá o prêmio, sem direito a compensação em dinheiro, e não será permitido transferir a experiência para outra pessoa. A atribuição do prêmio seguirá as regras estabelecidas neste documento.`,
      TyCtitle9: "9. Vigência e validade dos prêmios",
      TyCtext9: `Os prêmios mensais devem ser consultados e resgatados dentro do período indicado. Caso isso não ocorra, o participante perderá o direito ao prêmio. A equipe do Kaspersky Cup reserva-se o direito de modificar os prêmios, as quantidades de gols necessárias ou até mesmo cancelar o Programa em circunstâncias de força maior.
      
      Os gols não utilizados em um mês continuarão acumulando para o cálculo do Grande Prêmio, mas não poderão ser usados para resgatar o prêmio do mês seguinte. Também não poderão ser convertidos em dinheiro ou recompensas adicionais ao final do Programa.
      
      Caso o prêmio mensal não esteja disponível no país do participante, e somente em situações extremas, será entregue um equivalente em valor, no formato de gift cards da Amazon.
      
      É importante esclarecer que as imagens ou fotografias dos prêmios mensais exibidas na plataforma ou nas comunicações do Programa são meramente ilustrativas. Os prêmios poderão apresentar variações em características, design, cor ou disponibilidade, dependendo do país ou fornecedor. Nesses casos, será entregue uma versão equivalente ao prêmio anunciado.`,
      TyCtitle10: "10. Dados pessoais e comunicação",
      TyCtext10: `Ao participar do Programa, o participante autoriza a Kaspersky a coletar e processar seus dados pessoais para fins de administração do Programa. Isso inclui, mas não se limita a: número de contato, e-mail e informações relacionadas às jogadas e prêmios.
      
      O participante também autoriza a Kaspersky a entrar em contato para fins de acompanhamento do Programa e envio de notificações.`,
      TyCtitle11: "11. Responsabilidades",
      TyCtext11: `A Kaspersky não se responsabiliza por atrasos ou demoras na entrega dos prêmios enviados ao domicílio.
      
      Também não se responsabiliza por atrasos, cancelamentos ou modificações de viagens, nem por falhas de terceiros (companhias aéreas, serviços de hospedagem, entre outros). A responsabilidade do vencedor em relação ao prêmio de viagem limita-se ao cumprimento dos requisitos estabelecidos.`,
      TyCtitle12: "12. Legal e tributário",
      TyCtext12: `O Grande Prêmio não é transferível e não pode ser convertido em dinheiro. Qualquer obrigação fiscal aplicável ao prêmio é de responsabilidade do vencedor.
      
      O prêmio deverá ser utilizado exclusivamente pelo vencedor e não poderá ser delegado, cedido ou utilizado por terceiros sob nenhuma circunstância.`,
      TyCtitle13: "13. Aceitação",
      TyCtext13: `A participação no Programa implica a aceitação integral destes Termos e Condições e das decisões adotadas pela Kaspersky em relação ao Programa.`,
      TyCtitle14: "14. Contato e suporte",
