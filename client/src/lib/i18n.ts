        q1: {
          question: "How can I register a new deal?",
          answer: "To register a new deal, go to the 'Deals' section in the main menu and click 'New Deal'. Fill in all required fields such as product type, name, value, quantity, and close date. Once submitted, the deal will be pending administrator approval."
        },
        q2: {
          question: "How many points do I earn per deal?",
          answer: "Points are calculated automatically based on the deal value. Normally, you earn 1 point per dollar of the deal. Points are only credited once the deal is approved by an administrator. Some products or special campaigns may have point multipliers."
        },
        q3: {
          question: "How do I redeem my points for rewards?",
          answer: "Go to the 'Rewards' section where you can see all available rewards and the points needed for each one. Select the reward you want, verify that you have enough points, and click 'Redeem'. The request will be processed by an administrator and you'll receive a notification when it's approved."
        },
        q4: {
          question: "How long does it take to approve my deal?",
          answer: "Deal approval time varies depending on the complexity and volume of requests. Generally, deals are reviewed within 24-48 business hours. You'll receive an email notification when your deal is approved or if additional information is required."
        },
        q5: {
          question: "Can I cancel or modify a deal after submitting it?",
          answer: "Once a deal has been submitted, you cannot modify it directly. If you need to make changes, contact support through this button or send an email to the administrator. Pending deals can be modified by an administrator before approval."
        },
        q6: {
          question: "What should I do if I don't see my points reflected?",
          answer: "Points are credited automatically when your deal is approved. If your deal was approved and you don't see the points, check your points history. If the problem persists after 24 hours, contact support with the affected deal number."
        },
        q7: {
          question: "Do rewards have an expiration date?",
          answer: "Accumulated points do not expire, but some rewards may have limited availability due to stock. Special or seasonal rewards may only be available for a limited time. We recommend regularly checking the rewards catalog."
        },
        q8: {
          question: "How can I track my reward shipment?",
          answer: "Once your reward request is approved and shipped, you'll receive an email with tracking information. You can also check the status in the 'My Rewards' section where you'll see the current status (Pending, Approved, Shipped, Delivered)."

          question: "¿Cómo puedo registrar un nuevo deal?",
          answer: "Para registrar un nuevo deal, dirígete a la sección 'Deals' en el menú principal y haz clic en 'Nuevo Deal'. Completa todos los campos requeridos como tipo de producto, nombre, valor, cantidad y fecha de cierre. Una vez enviado, el deal quedará pendiente de aprobación por un administrador."
        },
        q2: {
          question: "¿Cuántos puntos gano por cada deal?",
          answer: "Los puntos se calculan automáticamente basándose en el valor del deal. Normalmente, ganas 1 punto por cada dólar del deal. Los puntos solo se acreditan una vez que el deal es aprobado por un administrador. Algunos productos o campañas especiales pueden tener multiplicadores de puntos."
        },
        q3: {
          question: "¿Cómo canjeo mis puntos por recompensas?",
          answer: "Ve a la sección 'Recompensas' donde podrás ver todas las recompensas disponibles y los puntos necesarios para cada una. Selecciona la recompensa que deseas, verifica que tienes suficientes puntos y haz clic en 'Canjear'. La solicitud será procesada por un administrador y recibirás una notificación cuando sea aprobada."
        },
        q4: {
          question: "¿Cuánto tiempo tarda en aprobarse mi deal?",
          answer: "El tiempo de aprobación de deals varía dependiendo de la complejidad y el volumen de solicitudes. Generalmente, los deals son revisados en un plazo de 24-48 horas hábiles. Recibirás una notificación por correo cuando tu deal sea aprobado o si se requiere información adicional."
        },
        q5: {
          question: "¿Puedo cancelar o modificar un deal después de enviarlo?",
          answer: "Una vez que un deal ha sido enviado, no puedes modificarlo directamente. Si necesitas realizar cambios, contacta al soporte a través de este botón o envía un correo al administrador. Los deals pendientes pueden ser modificados por un administrador antes de su aprobación."
        },
        q6: {
          question: "¿Qué hago si no veo mis puntos reflejados?",
          answer: "Los puntos se acreditan automáticamente cuando tu deal es aprobado. Si tu deal fue aprobado y no ves los puntos, verifica en tu historial de puntos. Si el problema persiste después de 24 horas, contacta al soporte con el número de deal afectado."
        },
        q7: {
          question: "¿Las recompensas tienen fecha de expiración?",
          answer: "Los puntos acumulados no expiran, pero algunas recompensas pueden tener disponibilidad limitada por stock. Las recompensas especiales o de temporada pueden estar disponibles solo por tiempo limitado. Te recomendamos revisar regularmente el catálogo de recompensas."
        },
        q8: {
          question: "¿Cómo puedo rastrear el envío de mi recompensa?",
          answer: "Una vez que tu solicitud de recompensa sea aprobada y enviada, recibirás un correo con la información de seguimiento. También puedes verificar el estado en la sección 'Mis Recompensas' donde verás el estado actual (Pendiente, Aprobado, Enviado, Entregado)."

Preencha todos os campos obrigatórios, como tipo de produto, nome, valor, quantidade e data de fechamento. Depois de enviado, o negócio ficará pendente de aprovação do administrador."
        },
        q2: {
          question: "Quantos pontos ganho por cada negócio?",
          answer: "Os pontos são calculados automaticamente com base no valor do negócio. Normalmente, você ganha 1 ponto por cada dólar do negócio. Os pontos só são creditados depois que o negócio é aprovado por um administrador. Alguns produtos ou campanhas especiais podem ter multiplicadores de pontos."
        },
        q3: {
          question: "Como resgato meus pontos por recompensas?",
          answer: "Vá para a seção 'Recompensas' onde você pode ver todas as recompensas disponíveis e os pontos necessários para cada uma. Selecione a recompensa que deseja, verifique se tem pontos suficientes e clique em 'Resgatar'. A solicitação será processada por um administrador e você receberá uma notificação quando for aprovada."
        },
        q4: {
          question: "Quanto tempo leva para aprovar meu negócio?",
          answer: "O tempo de aprovação do negócio varia dependendo da complexidade e do volume de solicitações. Geralmente, os negócios são revisados em 24-48 horas úteis. Você receberá uma notificação por e-mail quando seu negócio for aprovado ou se informações adicionais forem necessárias."
        },
        q5: {
          question: "Posso cancelar ou modificar um negócio depois de enviá-lo?",
          answer: "Depois que um negócio foi enviado, você não pode modificá-lo diretamente. Se precisar fazer alterações, entre em contato com o suporte através deste botão ou envie um e-mail para o administrador. Os negócios pendentes podem ser modificados por um administrador antes da aprovação."
        },
        q6: {
          question: "O que fazer se não vejo meus pontos refletidos?",
          answer: "Os pontos são creditados automaticamente quando seu negócio é aprovado. Se seu negócio foi aprovado e você não vê os pontos, verifique seu histórico de pontos. Se o problema persistir após 24 horas, entre em contato com o suporte com o número do negócio afetado."
        },
        q7: {
          question: "As recompensas têm data de validade?",
          answer: "Os pontos acumulados não expiram, mas algumas recompensas podem ter disponibilidade limitada devido ao estoque. Recompensas especiais ou sazonais podem estar disponíveis apenas por tempo limitado. Recomendamos verificar regularmente o catálogo de recompensas."
        },
        q8: {
          question: "Como posso rastrear o envio da minha recompensa?",
          answer: "Depois que sua solicitação de recompensa for aprovada e enviada, você receberá um e-mail com as informações de rastreamento. Você também pode verificar o status na seção 'Minhas Recompensas' onde verá o status atual (Pendente, Aprovado, Enviado, Entregue)."
